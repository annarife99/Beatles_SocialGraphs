    "\n",
    "Smart, Idealistic, Playful, Irreverent, Eclectic, among many others. Their youth personification and unmatched innovation led their music, from the not-so-simple love songs they started with to their later perfectionistic studio extravaganzas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, until Ringo Starr joined them in 1962. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following years, the Beatles had an accomplished career, but mainly divided into three main periods of relatively similar productivity: the first stage started from the establishment of the band until their attaining worldwide popularity in 1964, the second was from 1965 to 1967 with the most creative and significant output of the group, and the final stage (from 1968 to 1970) where they were working more individually and the band finally folded in 1970. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, what has made us choose this current project and build the network of songs of one of the most influential bands of all times is presented below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='darkgreen'> 1. Motivation   \n",
    "No band has influenced pop culture the way The Beatles have. They were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Currenly, after 50 years of their retirement from the stage and with more than 200 songs on streaming servies, The Beatles' Songs are still present on a daily basis, still catchy and played all over the world, remaining forever and likley to be  passing down from generation to generation. But...\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### <center> What do the Lyrics of Beatles' Songs hide ? </center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Thrilled with the idea, performing different analyses based on the lyrics of Beatles could reveal many interesting hidden facts over the career of the band. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### <font color='green'> 1.1 _Our Dataset:_\n",
    "All the data used in this project were mainly extracted from three different Web sites. Next, they are presented together with the code used to build the dataset. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**1)** **[The Beatles official Page](https://www.thebeatles.com/)**. It has been of great relevance to be able to have a reliable list of all available Beatles Songs, representing the nodes of Beatles network, together with its corresponding lyrics. The lyrics were then used to define the edges of the network under a specific criteria. In that way, <u>Section 1.4.1</u>  shows the code to obtain the API of the Beatles song from their official page to extract the lyrics, consequently stored in a txt. file. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**2)** **[The Beatles Wiki](https://beatles.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beatles_Wiki)**. It was created in 2006, and edited some years after, currently containing a total amount of 775 pages. It has represented our main source to extract information from the available wiki-pages of Beatles songs, such as its songwriter, its corresponding album and its release date to be used as the node attributes of the network. <u>Section 1.4.2</u>  presents the code to obtain the API of the Wiki-Pages of each Beatles song, which were consequently stored in a txt. file to extract all the necessary information. Nevertheless, few Wiki-pages of each corresponding song had some features missing, reason why the other two Web sites were used to counter that point. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** **[The Beatles Spotify Page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2)**. Their spotify profile was thought that could be used to find other minor attributes of each song related to music characterstics, such as the danceability, the key or tempo of each track. In <u>Section 1.4.3</u>, we present how the API of the Beatles Spotify Page was obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "After considerable data extraction from txt. file of the different sources, its consequent cleaning and preprocessing steps _(all detailed in Section 2)_, we ended up with a total number of **301 songs** to be able to build the most exiciting Beatles network of all times.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "### <font color='green'> 1.2 _Why?_\n",
    "After inspecting the literature, not many analysis have been focused on analyzing Beatles songs from a linguistic point of view, without revealing what makes their songs catchy and how they influenced each other. Fascinated by Beatles success and its music so many years after of their release, we were motivated enough to undertake the project of builing a network of Beatles songs and understand how could be related from a lyrics point of view. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### <center> Could we get into Beatles'mind ? </center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <font color='green'> 1.3 _Our Goal:_\n",
    "The main aim of this project was to **build a Network of Beatles Songs** to be able to perform a deep analysis of the following points:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Inspect how are Beatles songs related and inspired by each others, by also considering its songwritter. \n",
    "- Find communities of songs and their common particularities. \n",
    "- Perform a sentimental analysis to see which and how the most recurrent topics evoled over time. \n",
    "- Examine network growth to reveal Beatles' stages and their most inspirational years. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Overall, the current project could provide insights into songs and group dynamics of the Beatles and reveal many other features. "

It still can be observed how the positivity of beatles slightly decrease during the first years of the decade, reaching an average VADER value of 0.2 between 1965-1966. From there, VADER average values slightly increases reaching a maximum around 1968-1969 before doing a significant decrease on 1970, the year of their break-up.\n",

Of course it is true that is not enough at all to affirm that, but this gives space for our imagination. Is this increase in negativity related with the fact that their break-up was just around the corner? Could the break-up of the beatles have been predicted and therefore tried to be avoided if sentimental analysis had been implemented and this decrease in positivity had been detected before it was too late?"

    "From the table above, certain things can be concluded. Step by step, from the information extracted, most of the songs authorship correspond to Lennon and McCartney, which were clearly the main influences in terms of composing in the Beatles golden decade. With respect to the average number of words used per song, Harrison was the one that wrote shorter songs. However, when we compute which percentage of the total words used was unique, Harrison has the highest value. Meaning that although writing shorter songs he had slighlty a higher lexical vocabulary. We must keep in mind that this analysis is performed without considering stop words, which makes all these percentages higher. In terms of average length per word used, results show that it is almost the same in all writers, being to a small extent Lennon alone the one that wrote shorter words.\n",
